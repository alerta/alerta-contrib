Installation
------------

Clone the GitHub repo and run:

    $ python setup.py install

Or, to install remotely from GitHub run:

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/alerta/alerta-contrib.git#subdirectory=webhooks/statuscake

Note: If Alerta is installed in a python virtual environment then plugins
need to be installed into the same environment for Alerta to dynamically
discover them.

Configuration
-------------

The custom webhook will be auto-detected and added to the list of available API endpoints.

Add the Alerta API webhook URL in the Statuscake contact group webhook section
