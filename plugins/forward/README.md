Installation

Clone the GitHub repo and run:

    $ python setup.py install

Or, to install remotely from GitHub run:

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/alerta/alerta-contrib.git#subdirectory=plugins/forward

Note: If Alerta is installed in a python virtual environment then plugins
need to be installed into the same environment for Alerta to dynamically
discover them.

Configuration

configuration file and set plugin-specific variables either in the
server configuration file or as environment variables.

```python
PLUGINS = ['forward']
```

**Example**

```python
PLUGINS = ['enhance', 'forward']
FORWARD_URL = 'http://www.example.com/api'
FORWARD_API_KEY = 'client_api_key'
FORWARD_MAX_LENGTH = 3 # cycle detector
```
