Or, to install remotely from GitHub run:

need to be installed into the same environment for Alerta to dynamically
discover them.

Configuration

Add `pubsub` to the list of enabled `PLUGINS` in `alertad.conf` server
configuration file and set plugin-specific variables either in the
server configuration file or as environment variables.

```python
PLUGINS = ['pubsub']
```

if you want to use google service account for pubsub. You need to set it in `alertad.conf`:

```python
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE='path to service account json file'
```
